Exchange monitor, connects to various exchanges through API, may be useful to find arbitrage opportunities
It is a known fact that the Bitcoin prices differ from exchange to exchange. The question of how to help different markets find equilibrium by buying a cheap market and selling an expensive one, taking profit for the operation, has a long history.
This project's idea is to provide a live tool to compare exchanges' bid/ask (=buy/sell) prices to the same number which indicates a "fair" Bitcoin price for the moment. This creates a system of coordinates to the comparison, and clearly divides "cheap" markets from "expensive" ones. Obviously, the "fairness" concept is a subjective one. Usually, some kind of weighted average is used to generate a Bitcoin index.
